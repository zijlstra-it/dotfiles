# dotfiles
My Personal .files &amp; Setup for my Mac/Linux workstation based on multiple others.

## Background Ideas

I wanted to create an almost single setup for my local shell at first, then I thought it would be nice to replicate this to all remote systems I logon to. Then I started to use more and more a Mac as workstation while working remotely on Linux systems so these two needed some integration as well. 

This repo is based on many ideas and setups I've used in the past and created on the go, then I started to search on Github for some additional input. This repo of dotfiles is my summazation of all ideas and setups I've come by; at least that's the idea.

## Installation

Either clone the repo to `~/git/dotfiles` and run `make` or look at my `mac-ansible` repo; another remotely inspired repo for full workstation setups.
